## The DIY Path

### Step 1: Set Up Home Assistant

Install Home Assistant on your hardware of choice—Raspberry Pi, or any compatible platform. Make your smart home sovereign.

*Documentation for StartOS and Umbrel servers coming soon.*

### Step 2: Set Up Hashrate Heating Hardware

Choose your bitcoin mining heater (Avalon Mini 3, Avalon Q, or Nano 3s) and connect it to your local network.

### Step 3: Add Integrations

Install the Exergy integrations to connect Home Assistant to your mining hardware and mining pool.

### Step 4: Configure Automations

Use our blueprints as a starting point, or build your own automations from scratch. Tie together heat, thermostats, miners, temperature sensors, timing, and more.

### Step 5: Build Your Dashboard

Create a control interface using our templates or design your own. Visualize everything at a glance and control from anywhere.
