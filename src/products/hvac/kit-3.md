# Kit 3: Forced Air HVAC Buddy

*Coming soon*

Integrate bitcoin mining into your home's forced-air heating system.

## Concept

Kit 3 adds a bitcoin miner to your existing HVAC ductwork as "first stage" heat. Your furnace (gas, propane, or electric) serves as "second stage" backup.

## Expected Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Canaan Avalon Q | Duct-integrated bitcoin miner |
| Home Assistant Brain | Smart controller |
| Two-Stage Thermostat | Unified heating control |
| Duct Adapter Kit | Installation hardware |

## How It Works

```
[Return Air] → [Avalon Q] → [Supply Plenum] → [Ducts] → [Rooms]
                   ↓
            [Existing Furnace]
            (backup when needed)
```

1. **First Stage (Mining)**: Avalon Q heats return air before it enters the supply plenum
2. **Second Stage (Furnace)**: Your existing furnace activates only when the miner can't maintain temperature
3. **Smart Control**: Home Assistant orchestrates both heating stages

## Benefits

- **Offset fuel costs** - Bitcoin mining revenue reduces net heating expense
- **Maximize uptime** - Miner runs continuously during heating season
- **Seamless experience** - Single thermostat controls both heat sources
- **Backup guaranteed** - Existing furnace available when needed

## Requirements

- Forced-air HVAC system (ducted)
- Adequate return air space for miner installation
- 240V electrical circuit (typically)
- Compatible existing furnace or air handler
