# HVAC Integration

*Coming Soon*

## Concept

Integrate a bitcoin miner into your home's ductwork as "first stage" heat. Your existing furnace (gas, propane, or electric) serves as "second stage" backup heat.

### How It Works

1. Bitcoin miner heats air that feeds into your duct system
2. Custom thermostat controls the two-stage heating
3. Miner provides baseline heat while earning bitcoin
4. Existing furnace kicks in only when miner can't keep up

### Benefits

- Offset heating fuel costs with bitcoin mining revenue
- Maximize miner utilization during heating season
- Seamless integration with existing HVAC
- Single thermostat controls both heat sources

## Status

This product is currently in prototype development. Documentation will be added as the product nears release.
