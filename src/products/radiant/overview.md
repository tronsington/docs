# Radiant & Hydronic

*Coming Soon*

## Products in Development

### Standalone Radiant Boiler

A bitcoin miner powering a boiler for radiant floor heating or baseboard radiators.

**Use Case**: Homes with hydronic heating but no existing boiler, or those wanting to add a zone.

### Radiant Boiler Buddy System

Pair a bitcoin-powered boiler with your existing boiler in a two-stage configuration.

**Use Case**: Supplement your existing hydronic system with bitcoin mining heat as the first stage.

### How It Works

1. Bitcoin miner generates heat
2. Heat is transferred to water/glycol in a boiler system
3. Heated fluid circulates through radiant floors or radiators
4. Custom controls manage the heating system

## Status

These products are currently in prototype development. Documentation will be added as products near release.
