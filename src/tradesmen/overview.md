## Who This Is For

- **HVAC contractors** evaluating or installing hashrate heating
- **Electricians** planning circuits for mining equipment
- **General contractors** managing installation projects
- **Property managers** overseeing multiple installations

## Key Concepts

### Hashrate Heaters Are Space Heaters

From an installation perspective, bitcoin mining heaters behave like any other electric space heater:

- **Predictable heat output** - 1W of electricity = 1W of heat (3.41 BTU/h)
- **No combustion** - No venting, no gas lines, no CO concerns
- **Standard electrical** - 120V or 240V depending on model
- **Location flexibility** - Place where heat is needed

### The Smart Home Component

What makes hashrate heaters different is the control system:

- **Network connected** - Requires WiFi (miner) and ethernet (controller)
- **Programmable** - Automated schedules and temperature control
- **Monitorable** - Real-time status and performance data
- **Integratable** - Can work with existing smart home systems
