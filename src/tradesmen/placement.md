# Placement & Airflow

Optimal positioning for hashrate heating equipment.

## General Principles

### Heat Distribution

- Hot air rises - lower placement often distributes better
- Direct exhaust toward the area to be heated
- Consider furniture and obstacles in airflow path
- Multiple units can provide more even coverage

### Airflow Requirements

All air-cooled mining heaters require:
- **Clear intake** - Cool air enters (usually bottom or rear)
- **Clear exhaust** - Hot air exits (usually front or top)
- **Room ventilation** - Adequate air exchange to prevent heat buildup

### Mounting Options

| Method | Best For | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Floor (feet) | Most installations | Included feet provide intake clearance |
| Wall mount | Space-saving, directed heat | Included brackets, mount to studs |

### Critical Requirements

**Level orientation required**
- Device has internal orientation sensors
- Will error and beep if tilted
- Use a level during installation

**Intake clearance (bottom)**
- Minimum few inches from floor/surface
- No carpet or soft surfaces blocking
- Feet automatically provide clearance

**Exhaust clearance (front)**
- Do not obstruct with furniture/curtains
- 12"+ clearance recommended
- Direct toward area to be heated

## Location Selection

### For Best Heating

- Near the area that needs heat
- Lower in the room (heat rises)
- Away from exterior doors (drafts)
- Consider existing HVAC vent locations

### For Noise Management

- Avalon Mini 3: <45 dB (similar to quiet conversation)
- Place away from quiet areas if noise-sensitive
- Bedrooms may need quieter modes at night
- Wall mounting can transmit some vibration

### For Temperature Sensing (Kit 2)

When using wireless temperature sensors:
- Place sensor AWAY from the heater
- Not in direct exhaust path
- Representative location for the room
- 3-5 feet from floor (average breathing height)

## Safety Considerations

### Clearances

| Direction | Minimum Clearance |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Front (exhaust) | 12 inches |
| Sides | 6 inches |
| Top | 12 inches |
| Bottom | 3 inches (feet) |

### Prohibited Locations

- Near flammable materials (curtains, paper)
- In enclosed spaces without ventilation
- Where water could contact the unit
- Blocking emergency exits
- Where it could be knocked over

### Fire Safety

- Equipment is UL listed
- No open flame or exposed heating element
- Internal thermal protection
- Automatic shutdown on overtemperature

## Hydronic Equipment (Heat Core)

Liquid-cooled units have different requirements:
- No airflow requirements (sealed system)
- Level installation required
- Plumbing access for connections
- Consider pump/valve access for service
- Silent operation - placement more flexible

## Multi-Unit Layouts

For multiple heaters in one space:
- Distribute for even coverage
- Each needs individual clearances
- Consider zone control capabilities
- Plan electrical for each location
